This is a selected set of code from the research I conducted with the Kundaje Lab as a high school freshman to junior, from Jun 2022 â€“ May 2024. While working for the Kundaje Lab, I implemented BPNet in Drosophila melanogaster for the first time and helped develop a bimodal deep learning framework incorporating genetic sequence and chromatin environment to predict for transcription initiation in humans.
